          During this block, I think I don’t learned too much things. I felt that I became a bad student. I fell everything was very bad but I don’t know what I have to do.

          In previous blocks I always read the book and prepared the lesson before the class. I always spend long hour with the book and a dictionary.I read very carefully each the reading. I look up what is the meaning and the pronunciation of the difficult words. Even I learned by heart the reading in each unit. In those days English was very important for me. I wished I could have more time to study. But now English is something very boring. I don’t know why? I try to complete a reading but I can’t pay my attention for over three minutes. In this block there were a lot of difficult new words but from the begin until now I’d never learned a quizlet lesson. Test quizlets most of them I was cheated. Video the teacher made me finish, I always submit at the last-minute. I can understand why I hate English and the class like this.

          But anyway, I learned some interesting things which are pretty useful. Everything was so boring until my teacher taught Unit 8 : Humor. It was really fun from the first thing. My teacher started the lesson by a game with a lot of fun questions. We had five groups each group had four members. The group gots the highest score could have ten dojo scores. The questions was about everything: a funny picture, a hilarious word and doing a trick to respond the question… All of them made ous laugh and feel crazy. After each turn we had to surprise. To have fast and right answer, group must have a little intelligence and must stay awake from start to finish. Very excitedly until the last question. My team’s score was equaling to Tung’s group. That question would decide the champion. A picture appeared with a word: “rood”, the question: “This word makes you think about what word?”. Quickly Tung said: “door”. “What’s kind of door?”- my teacher asked. “Back door”- I said, I was the first. The winner should be my group but I pronounced wrong the word. I failed, I couldn’t believe it. Another member in Tung’s group pronounced correct that word and got ten dojo score. That was the way my teacher started the most interesting lesson.

          Every day in my class, we do a boring activity which I don’t like anymore that is working in group. Working in group makes me crazy and I think it can’t make any results for students. If I was in a group, I would see one or more members who will never be willing to work with other members. Cooperation is the must when work together. Each person was given a task and that person has responsibility to accomplish it. If a member meets difficult questions, other members must give a hand. Everyone are in one group so don’t have the right to leave someone or nobody have the right to leave group. Only trying hard and contribution can make group succeed. Put group higher than individual. I’m very sure that all of my friends know these things even they know clearly more than I know. But the things they actually did were very opposite. “I’m sorry, I’m lated, I’m forgot, I’m too busy, Can you forgive for me, I came home with my mother…” There are many kind of refusing I must hear. Anytime I had to hear those things I start getting disappointed and angry. I wonder why people can be irresponsible like that, agreed to do their path and then disappear. Even some members don’t talk to group that they are busy and they can’t do that at that time, they don’t seem to care about other. I think why these people go to school, why not stay at home for other people not to be angry. Working in group is a wonderful lesson in school, but because of them It becomes a really bad thing. As long as I don’t have to study with irresponsible people, I may have many great experiences. After several times I got into these situations, I got used to this kind of working in group. I said to myself: ”Ok, fine. I will do this alone by myself, and I will don’t need help from anyone.”. And then I like to work alone more than anything, other people just sit down, keep silence and do nothing, the rest of the task let me done. I realized that I have an amazing ability to work independently. Maybe working in group raised working alone.

          I’m sorry because this writing I only focused on bad things. I’m really sorry. At least, these last leesons are very fun and interesting. I moved to the second table to have more attention, I raised my hand to debate and contribute to the lesson. I must admit that my friends are very excellent students. Tung he can write so fast although his grammar is so hilarious. Cuong he always gets ten score for quizlet test. Ohhhh his God! He is not human, he is a superman. I’m also really surprize that Nam and Hoan sing very well. They perform like a professional singer, when they sing I can’t recognize when are them where is the real singer. And last the two most important members, they are a big motivation for me to… They are Hai Anh and Le. They are two of a kind in my class, I can’t imagine what will happen with my class without them.
